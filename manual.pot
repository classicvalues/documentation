"DC offset is usually undesirable. For example, in audio processing, a sound "
"that has DC offset will not be at its loudest possible volume when "
"normalized (because the offset consumes headroom), and this problem can "
"possibly extend to the mix as a whole, since a sound with DC offset and a "
"sound without DC offset will have DC offset when mixed. It may also cause "
"other artifacts depending on what is being done with the signal."
